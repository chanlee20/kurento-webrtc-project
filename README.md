=====================

Kurento Java Tutorial: WebRTC one to many video call.

Fullstack development of utilizing the kurento media server and used WebRTC API to generate an N to N monitoring system.

The viewer side (person who monitors videos) and sender side (camera which shows to the viewer side) are differentiated through url.

The sender first accesses its camera and connects it to a media pipeline.
The viewer can then access the rooms automatically generated by the sender side (used sockets and NodeJS to accomplish this) which would connect them to the media pipeline from the sender side and exchange ICE candidates that would fulfill the connection.

If the viewer wants to see various cameras simultaneously, then the viewer can merge the different rooms.
Different layouts of the cameras are supported.
Cameras that are shown are recorded and automatically saved when the connection is lost.
